## Image Optimization

Before adding images:

1. **Resize** to 1920x1080px (or similar 16:9 ratio)
2. **Compress** using:
   - [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) - Free, easy
   - [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) - Advanced options
   - Photoshop/ImageOptim
3. **Check file size** - aim for 200-500KB per image
4. **Verify quality** - images should look sharp

## Current Design Features

Once you add images, you'll see:

✅ **Full-screen background images** with smooth transitions
✅ **Elegant overlays** for text readability
✅ **Premium gold accents** matching your brand
✅ **Smooth animations** between slides
✅ **Professional typography** with shadows for clarity
✅ **Luxury feel** with backdrop blur effects

## Troubleshooting

### Images not showing?
- Check file names are exactly: `hero-1.jpg`, `hero-2.jpg`, `hero-3.jpg`
- Verify images are in `public/` folder (not `public/images/`)
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors

### Images look blurry?
- Use higher resolution images (1920x1080px minimum)
- Don't over-compress (keep quality at 80%+)
- Use JPG format (better for photos than PNG)

### Text hard to read?
- The design includes dark overlays for readability
- If still hard to read, choose images with darker backgrounds
- Or adjust overlay opacity in code (contact developer)

## Fallback

If images don't load, the site will show:
- Beautiful gradient background (gold/plum colors)
- All text and buttons still work perfectly
- Design remains elegant and functional

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Add hero images (this guide)
2. ✅ Add gallery images (see `IMAGES_README.md`)
3. ✅ Add your logo (if you have one)
